# Expo AsyncStorage Issue in Background Mode

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications running in the background. The problem arises because AsyncStorage's functionality might be limited or unavailable when the app is not actively in the foreground.

## Problem Description

The primary symptom is unexpected behavior or application crashes related to AsyncStorage operations when the app is backgrounded.  Error messages may not always be informative.

## Solution

The most effective solution depends on your use case. Consider these alternatives:

* **Alternative Storage:** Explore persistent storage options like SQLite or MMKV, which are better suited for background operations.
* **Foreground Service:** Maintain a foreground service (requires explicit user permission) to ensure your app stays active and AsyncStorage remains functional. 
* **Data Synchronization:** Implement a mechanism to synchronize data with a remote server (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) to handle background persistence reliably.
* **Reduce AsyncStorage Reliance:** If possible, refactor your application to minimize reliance on AsyncStorage for background processes.
